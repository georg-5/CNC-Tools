# CNC-Tools
Hi, this is my first IOS pet project which helps me in my main job as a CNC operator. The app calculates cutting modes and saves them so that you can quickly adjust your work in the future. There is also some trigonometry. The project is written in Swift and uses SwiftUI, CoreData, StoreKit, Firebase, SwipeActions(@aheze), and ConfettiSwiftUI(@simibac) frameworks.
